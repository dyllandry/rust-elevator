    ✔ model an elevator's data @done(22-08-15 20:30)
        elevator
            floor: int
            direction: up/down option
            pickup_requests: what floor they are on and if they want to go up or down
            dropoff_requests: what floor they want to go to
    ☐ design basic "tick" system for elevator
        The elevator does not need an intelligent way of determining where to go next. For now, it can just process all pickup requests before it processes any dropoff requests.

    ☐ create tui
